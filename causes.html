			<h1>What are the causes of global warming?</h1>
			<h3>The Greenhouse effect</h3>

			<p>
				The greenhouse effect refers to what happens when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere act as a greenhouse to the planet, by trapping heat and using it to warm the Earth.
				This natural process is what keeps the Earth warm enough for humans to live on, but in recent years it has become something of a hazard for the planet.
				Human interference is causing the amount of "greenhouse gases" in the atmosphere to increase, thereby also increasing average temperatures and causing global warming.

			<h4>Human CO2 Emission</h4>
			<p>
				As we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas for energy or cut down and burn forests to create pastures and plantations, carbon accumulates and overloads our atmosphere.
				CO2 survives in the atmosphere for a long time— hundreds of years— so its heat-trapping effects are compounded over time. Of the many heat-trapping gases, 
				CO2 puts us at the greatest risk of irreversible changes if it continues to accumulate unabated in the atmosphere—as it is likely to do if the global economy 
				remains dependent on fossil fuels for its energy needs. 
				<!-- Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began. -->
			<p>
			<p>
				Certain waste management and agricultural practices aggravate the problem by releasing other potent global warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide.
